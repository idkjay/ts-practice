Steps
1. Create .ts file. 
2. Write code in it.
3. Compile it into a JavaScript file with tsc filename.ts. This will create a file with the same name but as a JavaScript file.
4. Do what you wanna do with the JavaScript file like in this program specifically, it does <script src="app.js" defer></script> in the index.html file.

Other stuff
1. npm --save-dev lite-server && npm start to host this program on a localhost:3000 that updates automatically anytime you change anything (have to compile first though). It's pretty nice.
